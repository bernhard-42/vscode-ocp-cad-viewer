# Change Log

All notable changes to the "OCP CAD Viewer" extension will be documented in this file.

## v2.8.7

**Fixes**

- Startup now checks all visible python files for trigger statements. If any has, autostart kicks in.

-	Remove XYZ axes from bottom left corner of save_screenshot ([#124](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/124))
-	Fixed rendering a compound made of multiple object types ignoring labels and colors ([#125](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/125))
-	Fixed double clicking a vertex or edge throwing an error in Javascript ([#129](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/129))

**Docs**

-	Provide better documentation for show_all ([#142](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/142))
  
**Breaking changes:**

- The install commands for libraries and the quickstart commands have been simplified. There is just one configurable command now that uses `pip`. For any other package manager, the command needs to be outdated in settings. 
Open `settings.json` and remove the old configuration. Then use the VS Code preferences to change the new defaults to your linking.
The extension identifies the situation where updated configurations are loaded from the local `settings.json` and provides these error messages:

  - "Your installCommands are outdated. Please update them in your settings.json ('OcpCadViewer.advanced.installCommands')"

  - "Your Quickstart is outdated. Please update them in your settings.json ('OcpCadViewer.advanced.quickstartCommands')"

- Until cadquery 2.6 is on pypy: When you want to install build123d and cadquery in parallel, you first need to change the cadquery install command to 

  ```bash
  [
    "{unset_conda} {python} -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery.git"
  ]
  ```

## v2.6.1

**Fixes:**

- Standalone viewer can listen to other IP addresses of the machine than 127.0.0.1
- `show` now uses port 3939 as default when no port could be detected and a service listens to 3939
- Fixed a bug in ocp-tessellate for cadquery wires ([#116](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/116))
- Fixed a bug in backend for measures that prevented faces being inspected ([#115](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/115))
- Fixed a bug that shifted the orientation too high for the logo screen


## v2.6.0

**New features:**

- Standalone mode without VS Code: `python -m ocp_vscode`. This will start a Flask server and the viewer can be reached under `http://127.0.0.1/viewer`.

**Fixes:**

- Fix that `show_all` doesn't ignore `_123` and similar variable names


## v2.5.3

- Fix regression that backend couldn't start on Windows (wrong quotes)

## v2.5.0

**New features**

- New click-to-center feature: shift-meta left-click at any point will take this point projected on the objects as the viewing target ([#95](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/95))
- Measure selections can be fully deselected on right mouse click ([#94](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/94))
- The command `show` now warns only when viewer is not running to allow export objects without viewing ([#98](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/98))

**Fixes:**

- Change `reset_camera=Camera.KEEP` to adapt zoom so that view doesn not "jump" ([#105](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/105))
- Use cachetools 5.5.0 to support Python 3.12. Additionally the resize button will now always resize to zoom level 1.0 ([#107](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/107))
- Python paths in the extension are now quoted to allow paths with spaces ([#102](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/102))
- The viewer window was slightly shifted to the left and did not fit the VSCode window ([#101](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/101))

## v2.4.1

- Fix colormap handling to keep color of objects when .color attribute is set
- show() ends gracefully and empty lists are treated correctly

## v2.4.0

**New features**

- Removed `measure_tools` parameter and integrated switching between normal and measure mode into the [three-cad-viewer](https://github.com/bernhard-42/three-cad-viewer/blob/master/src/treeview.js) ([#58](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/58)).
- Rewrote the CAD view tree to use lazy loading (switching to measure mode can increase number of nodes by more then 100 times). This changed the input format for the viewer component (states integrated into object tree now), which is a breaking change if you use threee-cad-viewer directly, but no changes for users of vscode-ocp-cad-viewer.
- Rewrote converter of [ocp-tessellate](https://github.com/bernhard-42/ocp-tessellate/blob/main/ocp_tessellate/convert.py) to be more consistent and easier to maintain. All solids and faces can now be instances. Breaking changes if you use ocp_tessellate directly, but no changes for users of vscode-ocp-cad-viewer.
- Added `center_grid` to workspace configuration to ensure grid planes always go through world origin ([#77](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/77)).
- Added `save_screenshot(filename)` to save a PNG of the currently shown object(s). Canvas only, no CAD tools ([#86](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/86)).
- Support viewing of build123d `LocationList`s.

**Fixes**

- Fixed the mini-build123d `Location` class used by measurement backend.
- Measure mode cannot work on clipped object, so disabled clipping tab when measure mode is turned on ([#55](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/55), [#70](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/70))
- Removed using `to_tuple` for build123d Color objects ([#69](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/69)).
- Made color handling more consistent (sometime `color` or `alpha` was ignored).
- Fixed opening duplivcate Jupyter notebooks ([#78](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/78)).
- Fixed measure tool related regression. ([#81](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/81), [82](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/82),).
- Fixed ImageFace aspect ratio bug ([#83](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/83)).
- Fixed `show_all` failing on empty ShapeList ([#90](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/90)).
- Fixed to display ShapeList of Compound correctly ([#91](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/91)).
- Fixed ShapeList containing different object types ([#92](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/92)).
- Fixed measure tools to work with 1D objects ([#93](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/93)).

## v2.3.3

- Fix regression that visual debug hangs
- Fix regression that build123d sketches are not draw correctly any more (fix in ocp-tessellate)

## v2.3.2

- Fix regression that Python script hang in threading before exit ([#73](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/60))

## v2.3.1

- Add latest ocp-tessellate to fixed regression with handling instances
- Make native default if ocp-addons exists

## v2.3.0
Fine tune communication to ensure the memory view of buffers will be passed through to javascript for performance (\*)
Use of the new protocol v3 of three-cad-viewer
Fix show_all regressions https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/71. It should also properly catch exceptions now to not interrupt viausl debugging
Add newest ocp-tessellate to allow using native tessellator from ocp_addons

## v2.2.2

- Fix regression in measure tools

## v2.2.1

- Fix: Wrong back material color for faces
- Improve parameters of Imageface
- Improve clipping when faces are deselected

## v2.2.0

- Clipping now works with caps (default: red, green, blue cap faces). For assemblies the cap faces can use the associated object colors
- Grid now can be centered (parameter: `center_grid=True`):
  With axes0==True centered at the origin `(0,0,0)`, i.e absolute units
  With axes0==False centered at the center of mass, i.e relative units
- Grid now has numbers at the gridlines serving as a ruler ([#60](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/60))
- `ocp_vscode` now has a class `ImageFace`. It works like an OCP rectangle, but can get an image path and a location ([#28](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/28)).
  Usage: `plane = ImageFace(image_path, width, location=Location((x, y, z), (ax, ay, az)))`
- The CAD tree changed behavior: The eye icon toggles both faces and edges. The mesh icon toggles the mesh (edges) only ([#56](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/56))
  This can be switched back to old behavior in the VS Code workspace settings _"OCP CAD Viewer > View:New_tree_behavior"_
- New parameter `show_sketch_local`: when set to `False`, `build123d` local sketches will not be shown (works eith `set_defaults`) ([#59](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/59))
- New parameter _"OCP CAD Viewer > Advanced:Autohide Terminal"_ in the VS Code workspace settings to control whether terminal will be hid when the viewer starts or not ([#61](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/61))
- Viewer keeps clipping settings when `reset_camera` is set to `Camera.KEEP`or `Camera.CENTER` ([#43](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/43))
- Material configurator now has a reset button "R" to get back to initial values
- `show_all` now converts nested dicts and lists into viewer hierarchies
- `set_viewer_config` is documented in README
- Fix: `show_parent` now supported by `show_defaults` ([#64](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/64))
- Fix: `show_all()` now works in non visual debugging mode (removed `force` parameter from `show_all`)
- Fix: `show_all()` now doesn't break when an array of `Colors` is in the `locals` variable list ([#45](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/45))
- Fix: `show_all` now ignores unknown types in lists or dicts without raising an error and only printing a warning ([#67](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/67))
- Fix: The `serialize` and `deserialize` commands don't crash on Windows any more ([#65](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/65))
- Fix: Status notifications for grid work again ([#66](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/66))

## v2.1.1

- Fix Jupyter Console for non-workspace mode
- Enforce using latest ocp-tesellate 2.0.6

## v2.1.0

- Introduce a minimum version of build123d for backend.py to remove the Python dependency on buidl123d.
- Changed the state handling: instead of distributed `.ocp_vscode` files, there is now one central `$HOME/.ocpvscode` file.
- Experimental Jupyter console support: When starting an interacive session, the kernel connection file will be writte to `$HOME/.ocpvscode`.
  This file will be used in the Viewer Manager under _jupyter console_ to open the jupyter console as another client for the kernel
- Use a VS Code Terminal for the backend so that it is no black box any more
- Enforce using latest ocp-tesellate 2.0.5
- Streamline the vsix to be <1MB

## v2.0.13

- Fix shortcut boolean parameter for grid
- Update dependencies for installing build123d on Apple Silicon
- Ensure terminal is shown during installations
- Refactor getCurrentFolder
- Create demo file in current folder instead of temp folder
- Use new environment API to get Python path
- Handle showing empty CAD objects with show_all
- Ensure to set ocp_vscode_version for quick install
- Add python 3.11 for Apple Silicon machines

## v2.0.6

- Add three-cad-viewer 2.1.2 to fix black edges issue in measure mode and remove angle tool resizing

## v2.0.4

- Fix regression of ocp-tessallate version

## v2.0.3

- Fix regression in port detection
- Added missing dependencies for build123d on Apple Silicon

## v2.0.2

- Fix .ocp_vscode detection on Windows
- Fix showing ShapeList[Vector]
- Viewer now starts when VS Code opens with a build123d/cadquery Python file

## v2.0.1

- Introduce a workspace configuration `initialPort` for OCP CAD Viewer
- Change the warning about used port to an auto vanishing info

## v2.0.0

- Introduce measure mode. Use `set_defaults(measure_tools=True)` or `show(obj, measure_tools=True)` or the global workspace confiv of OCP CAD Viewer to turn it on. This release added a Python backend process that communicates with the viewer for providing correct BRep measurement info.
- Autostart viewer: When opening or saving a Python file that includes `import cadquery`, `import build123d`, `from cadquery import` or `from build123d import`, the viewer gets started if it is not already running. Use `OcpCadViewer.autostart` configuration of workspace config to turn this feature off.
- Environment variable OCP_PORT is supported. It will be used by the viewer and the `show*` clients as the port for OCP CAD Viewer. This variable can be set on the command line or in `launch.json` (`"env": {"OCP_PORT": "3999"}`).
- `CAMERA.KEEP` and `CAMERA.CENTER` now persist the viewer across execution sessions. If you want to reset at every beginning, use `show(objs, reset_camer=Camera.RESET)` as the first show command.
- Modifier keys can now be remapped `key={"shift": "shiftKey", "ctrl": "ctrlKey", "meta": "metaKey"}`. Valid keys are `shift`, `ctrl` and `meta`. Valid values are `shiftKey`, `ctrlKey`, `metaKey` (command on Mac and Windows on Windows) and `altKey` (option on Mac and Alt on Windows).
- The tool bar of the viewer is now icons only.
- The icons of he extension are SVG now, and hence follow the black/white style of VS Code.
- `show_all` has a parameter `force=True` to override the skipping behavior it has for visual debugging.
- Apple Silicon build123d install command is updated.

## v1.2.2

- Replace the boolean values for `reset_camera` with the `Camera` enum; `reset_camera` now supports `Camera.RESET` (works like `True` before), `Camera.CENTER` (works like `False` before) and `Camera.KEEP` (additionally keeps the pan location). See best practices for details.
- Replace the values for `collapse` with the `Collapse` enum: `Collapse.ALL` (was `"C"`), `Collapse.None` (was `"E"`), `Collapse.LEAVES` (was `"1"` or `1`) and `Collapse.Root` (was `"R"`)
- Added a button to toggle the output panel for OCP CAD Viewer
- Visual debug is on by default now (workspace setting `WatchByDefault` to `true`)
- Changed behavior of ` show` during debug session: `show` will be executed, however, visual debug step omitted
- Do not show Jupyter variables `_`, `__`, `_1`, `_2`, ... in `show_all`
- Fix an error where the orientation marker was partly or fully moved outside its view due to panning of the object ([vscode-ocp-cad-viewer issue #22](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/22))

## v1.2.1

- Fix: OCP_Part can be shown now ([vscode-ocp-cad-viewer issue #20](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/20))
- Fix: reset_camera respects panning ([vscode-ocp-cad-viewer issue #19](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/19))
- Fix: `collapse="C"` also collapses single item trees ([vscode-ocp-cad-viewer issue #18](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/18))
- Fix: Show_all supports having a sketch that uses face as a workplane ([vscode-ocp-cad-viewer issue #17](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/17))
- Fix: `_config==undefined` is handled properly ([vscode-ocp-cad-viewer issue #12](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/issues/12))

## v1.1.3
